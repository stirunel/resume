    {Staff Engineer}
    {San Diego, CA}
    \item Defined the SW architecture for the receive chain operation in 5G NR 
    Sub6 and Millimeter-wave â€“ in Qualcomm flagship 5G modems - SDX50 and SDX55.
    \item Established call flows and designed them to fit within the timeline 
    needs of 5G NR Millimeter-wave.
    \item Continuously worked with multiple teams - firmware, RF systems, 
    Modem systems - to understand the scope of any feature, design the call 
    flow, and set the expectation for deliverables.
    \item Designed SW task plans to project the resource needs to meet certain 
    milestones before the arrival of RF chipsets. 
    \item Developed SW drivers to control feedback loops like Rx AGC 
    (Automatic Gain control), AFC (Automatic frequency correction), and 
    Beam management.
    \item Developed FW drivers to precisely control the timing of each feedback 
    operation, in strict adherence to the tight timeline requirements of 5G NR.
    \item Core player in enabling LAA software developments and helped drive the 
    adoption of Qualcomm modem solutions with LTE-U/LAA technology.
    \item Developed LTE AS DIV (Antenna Switch Diversity) feature for customer 
    specific hardware suited to their unique requirements - Apple \& Samsung.
    \item Collaborate extensively with cross-functional teams in developing 
    features to utilize the new features offered by the chipset.
    \item Received 8+ Qualstar awards for outstanding contribution to 
    LTE/5G/WCDMA/IOT efforts.
